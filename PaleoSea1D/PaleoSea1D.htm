<h2>Purpose of the plug-in</h2>
<p>
PaleoSea1D is an IFM plugin for FEFLOW that makes it possible to simulate diffusive or advective-dispersive transport of salinity in a forming aquitard and in the underlying aquifer. The actual system is simplified into a 1D-vertical-column numerical model (2 nodes = 1 element in the X dimension; hundreds of elements/nodes in the Y dimension), with contrasting material properties for the aquitard vs. the aquifer. Conceptually simplified time series are used to describe the transient formation of the aquitard in terms of real thickness (sedaccum); the evolution of the sea/lake/surface water salinity (swconc); and, optionally, the evolution of the fluid (Darcy) flux to be imposed at the bottom of the model (ffluxbasebc).
